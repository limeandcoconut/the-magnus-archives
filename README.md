## What?
This is an experimental tool for managing notes. It is based around and was inspired by the need to manage notes regarding [The Magnus Archives](http://rustyquill.com/the-magnus-archives/) but could be used for lots of things. 

The whole project is based around the concept of 🚨**avoiding spoilers** 🚨. The package treats information as *highly* granular and links `nodes` (tidbits of information) together. All links are keyed to episode numbers so that by setting a single config a user can explore safely. **The tool will not return any information revealed in an episode later than the one you are on.**

**However** I'm currently keeping information stored flatfile in the repo so buyer beware that there may be stuff in the code you didn't intend to see. (If anyone else ever wants to use this I'd be glad to sanitize it)

It's in its infancy right now so if you have any interest in it or questions of any kind please don't hesitate to contact. Feel free to nudge me 👉 about creating a better README or just hmu to theorize about the archives. 🧛🏻‍♀️
